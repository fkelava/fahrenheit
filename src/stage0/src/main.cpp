/* [fkelava 12/09/26 23:26]
 * One of Fahrenheit's primary design tenets is that it should apply no permanent
 * modifications to the game binary or folder whatsoever. In keeping with that,
 * instead of modifying one of the DLLs the game imports as UnX and ffgriever EFL do,
 * it has an explicit launcher system- the Stage 0 and 1 loaders. If the game is not
 * launched using it, you get a pristine, unmodified original game.
 *
 * The method of choice applied here is reversible IAT patching using MS Detours.
 * Stage 0 creates the game process and rewrites the IAT to load Stage 1 first,
 * then serves as the standard output/error pipe for the game.
 * Stage 1 reverses that modification, then bootstraps .NET and Fahrenheit.
 *
 * Stage 0 also acts as a crash handler/debugger for the target binary. See `dbg.cpp`.
